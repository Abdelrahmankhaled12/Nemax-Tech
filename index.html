                        <p class="mt-4 mb-2">Digital Revolutions happen rarely and are marked by historic days and
                            moments. On 29 June 2007 the iPhone was presented, marking the birth of a new digital
                            revolution and witnessing the beginning of a new industry. Computers moved literally from
                            our desks to our pockets and a brand new industry for mobile applications took flight. </p>
                        <p class="mt-4 mb-2">Companies like Google (Alphabet) or Facebook (Meta) grew exponentially,
                            reached stratospheric market capitalizations, and produced astronomical revenues year after
                            year. Today, 5 billion people use the Internet, a number that continues to grow.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-4 mb-2">The Internet is massive and itâ€™s pervasive and now we are witnessing the
                            birth of a new digital revolution. The Bitcoin White Paper was published on Oct 21, 2008 and
                            that lone idea and blockchain network have given birth to over 1,000 blockchain networks.
                            Amongst all these networks, Bitcoin and Etheruem represent more than 60% of the new industry
                            known as web3.</p>
                        <p class="mt-4 mb-2">Web3 is the next iteration of the Internet that 5 billion users across the
                            world are using daily for many kinds of activities, such as ordering groceries, booking a
                            vacation, playing online games, listening to music, or accessing their finances. </p>
                        <p class="mt-4 mb-2">Web3 is a new digital revolution that is powered at its core by blockchain
                            technologies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Today, more than 350 thousand developers are
                            building this new generation of Internet and Nemax Tech is here to build the Internet of
                            tomorrow!</p>
